    "text": "The pipe organ has a vast history extending to ancient Alexandria, but the instrument began to more closely resemble what we see today during the Middle Ages in Europe, where it became a staple of Roman Catholic liturgy. Although instruments across the continent had similar traits and mechanics, by the Baroque era there were sweeping regional differences in construction and especially in tonal design. Even though the centuries of intervening development and global diffusion of technique mean that, for example, French Romantic traits can be observed in instruments from Charlestown to China, one can still identify national schools of organbuilding in modern-day work.\nOn a more concrete level, each organbuilder and each instrument for the most part are quite unique. The design and execution of a pipe organ (both visual and tonal) has always been a lengthy endeavor highly influenced both by prevailing stylistic ideals and the acoustical parameters of the church or hall for which it is built. Add to this variety the observation that no two stops of the same name on two different instruments ever sound fully alike (for even if they are built identically they are subject to different acoustics), and comparative analysis of pipe organs becomes quite a fascinating subject.\nHere the sheer volume of the Internet comes into view."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe goal of this site is to assist the student of the pipe organ by collecting and contextualizing some of the many freely available Internet resources pertaining to the instrument.\nIt is not intended as either a complete introduction to the pipe organ or a scholarly review of relevant resources. Rather, it serves to facilitate the rapid discovery and comprehension of some of the many existing resources on a variety of topics that I have found over the years.\nLinks to the Compendium’s resource pages may be found in the header above.\n(To whet your intellectual and musical appetite, enjoy this recording of early 20th-century Canadian-American organ virtuoso Lynwood Farnam’s Toccata by British-Australian organist Simon Nieminski.)"
