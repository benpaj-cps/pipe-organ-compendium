# Introduction

The goal of this site is to assist the student of the pipe organ by collecting and contextualizing some of the many freely available Internet resources pertaining to the instrument.

It is *not* intended as either a complete introduction to the pipe organ or a scholarly review of relevant resources. Rather, it serves to facilitate the rapid discovery and comprehension of some of the many existing resources on a variety of topics that I have found over the years.

Links to the Compendium's resource pages may be found in the header above.

(To whet your intellectual and musical appetite, enjoy this recording of early 20th-century Canadian-American organ virtuoso Lynwood Farnam's *Toccata* by British-Australian organist Simon Nieminski.)
