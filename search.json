Although instruments across the continent had similar traits and mechanics, by the Baroque era there were sweeping regional differences in construction and especially in tonal design. Even though the centuries of intervening development and global diffusion of technique mean that, for example, French Romantic traits can be observed in instruments from Charlestown to China, one can still identify national schools of organbuilding in modern-day work.\nOn a more concrete level, each organbuilder and each instrument for the most part are quite unique. The design and execution of a pipe organ (both visual and tonal) has always been a lengthy endeavor highly influenced both by prevailing stylistic ideals and the acoustical parameters of the church or hall for which it is built. Add to this variety the observation that no two stops of the same name on two different instruments ever sound fully alike (for even if they are built identically they are subject to different acoustics), and comparative analysis of pipe organs becomes quite a fascinating subject.\nHere the sheer volume of the Internet comes into play."

    "text": "Although organ keyboard technique bears obvious resemblance to that of the piano, the fundamental difference is that a key on one of a pipe organ’s manuals is much more like a switch, and there is no sustain pedal to prolong the note after the key is released.\nTherefore, organists must precisely control the timing of the attack and release of the key in order to sculpt articulation and phrasing.\nBecause the lack of sustain means that a break between notes is more obvious than on the piano, organists make frequent use of pure legato articulation, to such an extent that “always play legato” has sometimes been made an axiom, even with the works of J.S. Bach.\nOn the opposite extreme, the preoccupation with so-called “historically informed practice” in the mid-to-late 20th century meant that some organists used almost exclusively detached or (semi-)staccato articulation for Baroque composers, again including Bach.\nBoth of these views are severe generalizations that risk sacrificing the musicality and gravitas of many works, especially those of Bach. The correct answer is probably that articulation should be defined by the requirements of the music at hand, taking into reasonable account both the likely intentions of the composer and the specific needs of a given phrase in a given acoustical environment.\nThe point of this discursus is that consumption of both the below textbooks and of many Bach organ performances often requires a few grains of salt."

    "text": "Classic Texts\nThere is much overlapping information in the following old textbooks, and all three teach the “Bach legato”. I would suggest beginning with Stainer and referencing Dupré, with Barnes as a supplemental resource. Stainer dwells longer on the basics, while Dupré quite quickly dives into complicated finger substitutions, etc. Stainer also contains illustrated descriptions of pipe organ key and stop action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe usual caveats of musical self-study apply here (the risk of engraining ‘bad’ technique, etc.). Of course, the ideal would be to study with an excellent pedagogue within one’s own church tradition. However, where this is not feasible, I am more inclined than most to encourage going it on one’s own, especially because good piano technique forms a solid and necessary basis for organ playing (with a few modifications, described in the textbooks below), and good piano instruction is easier to find. More generally, good technique follows a few simple principles, including:\n\nAlways strive to exert the least effort. The best motion is the simplest, most relaxed, and least irritating (in other words, the “principle of minimal movement” applies). This necessitates a good pianistic foundation of finger strength/independence and natural hand shape at the keyboard.\nBe able to play in perfect legato wherever feasible. Of course, one may decide to use a fingering or pedalling which only allows detached articulation if this is consistent with good interpretation, but only if this is easier and less strenuous (according to the first principle above).\nBegin practicing at a speed which allows conscious control of every motion. When first starting out, this may mean playing one note every five seconds. That’s fine! Start there and progress as able.\n\n\n\n\nThe Organ (1877/1909) by Sir John Stainer (ed. Harker)\nMéthode d’orgue (1927) by Marcel Dupré\nSchool of Organ Playing (1921) by E.S. Barnes"
